##### Reverse Int
Summary: Given an integer find the reverse representation.
```
Given: x = -123 
Return -321
```


##### Reverse String
Summary: Given an string find the reverse representation 

```
Given = "hello" 
Return "olleh"
``` 

##### strStr
Summary: Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

```
Given: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll" 
Return: 2
```

##### FizzBuzz
Summary: For multiples of 5 and 3 print FizzBuzz, multiples of 5 print Fizz, multiples of 3 print Buzz, else just print the number
```
Example:
8: 8
9: Buzz
10: Fizz
15: FizzBuzz
```

##### Two Sum
Summary: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
```
Given:
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] 
target = 9

return [0, 1]
```

##### Add Two Numbers
 Sumary: Given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
 ```
 Given: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
 Return: 7 -> 0 -> 8
 ```
